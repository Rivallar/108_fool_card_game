----------------------------------108 fool------------------------------------

These game is similiar to UNO card game, but is played with classical
game cards and consists of several rounds.
A round ends when any player has no cards remaining in his hand. Other players
then count their round points based on cards they have at the end of the round.
This round points sum with results of previous rounds in a total score for each
player. First player who gets in total 108 points (you can set another value)
loses the game.

The more cards you have at the end of a round the more points you`ll get. So
your main goal is to get rid of as many cards as possible during a round!!!

There may be several losers if they reached this value at the end of the same
round.
Also if you want to start next game instantly, it will last till the highest
score of a loser from previous game. For example there were 2 losers with 109
and 117 points. New game will go till 117 points.

ROUND rules:
Players begin each round with 5 cards in hand.
First turn of every round is performed by a different player (one by one).
A card for the first  turn is chosen randomly from a hand of the first player.
So he goes first but can not choose a card.

Next player may use one of his cards meeting the requirements of the rules:
card suit or the value of the card must be same with the previously used
card. For example previous player used card "10 of diamonds". You can use any
card with diamond suit or 10 of any other suit.
If a player has no appropriate card in hand or he don`t want to use it,
he should draw one card from a deck. Then he can either use a card (any card
meeting the rules) or pass his turn to the next player.

When your hand is almost dry (one or two cards), there will appear a new button
with "One!" message on it. Don`t forget to push it every time! It informs other
players that you are close to finish this round (just like in UNO game). 
If you have finished a round and forgot to push the button you shall be "rewarded"
with penalty points!

When a round lasts too long there may be situation when you need to draw a card from
a deck, but the deck is dry. In this case the deck will be replenished again with used
cards and you shall earn penalty points for such replenishment.
Each replenishment causes more and more penalty points!
  

CARDS:
Each card has its "cost" - the amount of points to get at the end of a round.
Also many cards have special properties affecting game progress.
Lets review cards in depth:

6 	- costs six points. If a player uses this card, next player must draw two cards
	from a deck and pass his turn (he won`t be able to use his cards this time).
7 	- costs seven points. If a player uses this card, next player must draw one card
	from a deck and pass his turn (he won`t be able to use his cards this time).
8 	- costs eight points. No special rules for this card.
9 	- costs zero points. Reverses turn direction untill the end of a round or untill
	another 9 is used. F.e. next player to make a turn is sitting left to you
	(so your order of turns is clockwise). You use a 9-card and the turn order
	reverts to counter-clockwise. Next player to go is to the right of you now.
10 	- costs ten points. No special rules.
(J)ack  - costs two points. No special rules.
(Q)ueen - costs three points. Has a bit complicated rules. See special section below.
(K)ing  - costs four points. No special rules.
(A)ce   - costs eleven points. If a player uses this card, next player must pass his
	turn without using any cards.

QUEENS:
Queen is the most usefull card in the game, but may cause a lot of harm if used poorly.
If it is your turn, you can use any queen card regardless of a card used before it: f.e.
previously used card was "Jack of Spades" (or ANY other) and you can still go with your
"Queen of Hearts" (normally you must use only Spades cards or Jacks on top of "Jack of 
Spades").
Queens also able to change card suits: after using a queen you shall be asked to choose
a new card suit - four additional cards representing each suit will be displayed on your
screen. So after using your "Queen of Hearts" you may choose Clubs suit, because you
have a lot of Clubs cards in your hand. Next player will have to use only Clubs cards or
another queen to change suits again.

Thats not it yet!
Normally Queens cost 3 points at the end of a round (when you have several cards in hand).
BUT!: if another player finishes a round and you only have a single queen in hand it will
cost you 20 points (and even 40 points if it is "Queen of Spades")!
FINALLY: if YOU finish a round and the last card you used was a queen, you will be rewarded
with a 20 points (40 for the "Queen of Spades") discount, i.e. you`ll get -20 or -40 points
for these round.
So keeping a queen at the end of a round is always a risk. You may be punished or rewarded
for it. Choose wisely!

CONTROLS:
- use ENTER to make your turn
- use SPACE to draw a card from a deck or to pass your turn
- use left/right arrow to navigate through cards in your hand
- use mouse to choose special queen card
- use mouse or hotkeys to push in-game buttons

Thats all for the rules! Hope everything is clear now and you can play the game.
