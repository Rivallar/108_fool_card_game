# 108_fool_card_game

### Description

This pet project is designed to introduce myself as a Python developer and to improve my development skills further in different IT-technologies.
At this stage it is a simple single-player card game (with 2 bots) written on Python/Pygame.
However, there are a lot of plans for further development of this project: 
- scaling up the game for different number of players
- introducing extended deck
- making it available for multiplayer
- creating a website to log players’ statistic and schedule games
- introduce an in-game currency and ways to spend it, etc.

The main goal is not to make the game perfect but to *study and implement new technologies.* So, some aspects of the game like visual and controls may be not as good as they can.  
Mostly it’s because everything requires time.

Currently, I’m devoting my time to other projects, which will dividend me better in my development, but I shall definitely return to this one later.

### Installation

To run the game you only need Python3 with Pygame module installed  
Clone the project to your PC and enter its folder name  
Run command: `python3 fool_108_main.py`  

#### There is also a RULES file inside.
